INTRODUCTION
------------

The CKEditor Font Size and Family module enables the CKEditor Font Size and
Family plugin (https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/font) in your WYSIWYG editor.

This plugin adds Font Size and Font Family dropdowns that default apply as
inline element styles. The default collection of fonts includes most popular
serif fonts (Times New Roman, Georgia), sans-serif fonts (Arial, Verdana,
Tahoma), and monospaced fonts (Courier New).

The list of font sizes and styles can be easily customized for each text filter.
